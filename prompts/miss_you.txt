# Miss You Coupon Strategy Generator

**Context**: Generate a data-driven "Miss You" coupon strategy for our restaurant partner based on their customer behavior patterns. This is a win-back campaign targeting customers who haven't visited in a specific time period.

### 2. Historical Performance Insights
