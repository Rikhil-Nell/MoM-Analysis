# Triple Battle-Tested Coupon Strategy Generator

**Context**: Generate three proven coupon strategies for our restaurant partner: Stamp Card, Miss You, and Joining Bonus coupons. Analyze the restaurant's KPI data to create optimized versions of these battle-tested strategies with comprehensive cost-benefit analysis.

## Your Mission
Create data-driven versions of our three most successful coupon types, each tailored to this restaurant's specific customer behavior patterns, with detailed financial projections and combined impact analysis.

## Required KPI Data Analysis

### 1. Customer Lifecycle Analysis
- **New Customer Patterns**: Analyze first-time visitor behavior, conversion rates, and initial order values
- **Customer Retention**: Study visit frequency distributions, dormancy patterns, and churn timelines
- **Loyalty Progression**: Track how visit frequency correlates with customer lifetime value
- **Seasonal Variations**: Identify temporal patterns affecting all three strategies

### 2. Financial Baseline Metrics
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** across different customer segments and time periods
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** and current new customer acquisition rates
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** for different frequency segments
- **Profit Margins** per order and per customer segment
- **Current promotional spend** and effectiveness

### 3. Competitive & Market Context
- **Platform Dependency**: Current reliance on Swiggy/Zomato and associated costs
- **Market Saturation**: Local competition and customer acquisition difficulty
- **Pricing Sensitivity**: Historical response to discounts and promotional offers

## Three Coupon Strategies Required

### 1. STAMP CARD COUPON
**Purpose**: Increase visit frequency among existing customers
**Analysis Focus**: 
- Current visit frequency patterns by customer segment
- Optimal stamp requirement (5, 7, 10 visits) based on natural behavior
- Appropriate timeframe (30, 45, 60 days) for completion
- Most compelling reward based on popular items and profit margins

### 2. MISS YOU COUPON  
**Purpose**: Reactivate dormant customers and reduce churn
**Analysis Focus**:
- Customer dormancy patterns (when do customers typically stop visiting?)
- Optimal trigger timing (15, 30, 45 days since last visit)
- Segmented approach for different customer value tiers
- Most effective win-back incentive based on past preferences

### 3. JOINING BONUS COUPON
**Purpose**: Acquire new customers and improve first-time visitor conversion
**Analysis Focus**:
- Current new customer acquisition rates and conversion patterns
- Competitive landscape for new customer offers
- Optimal incentive level to drive trial without attracting deal-hunters
- Balance between attractiveness and profitability

## Cost Analysis Requirements

For each coupon, calculate:
- **Redemption Rate Projections** (based on historical data and industry benchmarks)
- **Incremental Sales Impact** (additional orders generated beyond baseline)
- **Discount Investment** (total promotional spend required)
- **Revenue Uplift** (gross revenue increase from additional visits)
- **Net Profit Impact** (revenue increase minus discount costs and operational costs)
- **Break-even Analysis** (minimum performance required for profitability)
- **ROI Timeline** (when the investment pays back)

## Detailed Analysis Framework

### For Each Coupon Design:
1. **Specific Terms**: Exact discount amount, conditions, validity, restrictions
2. **Target Audience**: Which customer segments will receive this coupon
3. **Timing Strategy**: When and how frequently to deploy
4. **Success Metrics**: KPIs to track effectiveness

### For Each Cost Analysis:
1. **Investment Required**: Total promotional budget needed
2. **Expected Redemption**: Projected usage rates based on data
3. **Incremental Revenue**: Additional sales beyond natural baseline
4. **Net Profit Impact**: Bottom-line effect after all costs
5. **Risk Factors**: Potential downsides and mitigation strategies

### For Combined Analysis:
1. **Portfolio Effect**: How the three coupons work together synergistically
2. **Customer Journey Impact**: Movement through acquisition → retention → loyalty
3. **Total Investment vs Return**: Overall ROI of the complete strategy
4. **Implementation Priority**: Which coupon to launch first and why
5. **Success Benchmarks**: What constitutes success for the combined approach

## Critical Success Factors

- **Data Grounding**: Every recommendation must be backed by specific KPI insights
- **Financial Viability**: All projections must be realistic and achievable
- **Implementation Clarity**: Restaurant owner should understand exactly what to do
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Clear metrics for tracking success
- **Competitive Advantage**: Strategies should differentiate from platform offers

## Expected Outcomes

Your analysis should demonstrate:
- **20-30% increase in new customer acquisition** (Joining Bonus)
- **15-25% reactivation of dormant customers** (Miss You)  
- **40-60% improvement in visit frequency** among loyalty program participants (Stamp Card)
- **Overall positive ROI within 90 days** for the combined strategy
- **Reduced platform dependency** and improved direct customer relationships

Focus on creating a cohesive strategy where these three battle-tested coupons work together to build a complete customer lifecycle optimization system.
