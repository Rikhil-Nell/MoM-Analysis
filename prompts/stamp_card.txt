# Digital Stamp Card Loyalty Program Generator

**Context**: Create a data-driven digital stamp card loyalty program for our restaurant partner. This is a frequency-building strategy that rewards customers for repeat visits within a specific timeframe, encouraging higher visit frequency and customer stickiness.

## Your Task
Analyze the restaurant's KPI data to design an optimal digital stamp card program that maximizes customer visit frequency while ensuring profitability and sustainable growth.

## Required Analysis Steps

### 1. Visit Frequency Baseline Analysis
- Load customer visit frequency data across different time periods
- Calculate average visits per customer per month/week
- Identify current visit distribution patterns (1x, 2x, 3x+ visitors per month)
- Determine natural visit cycles for different customer segments

### 2. Customer Value & Behavior Segmentation
- Analyze average order value across different visit frequencies
- Identify high-frequency vs low-frequency customer spending patterns
- Calculate customer lifetime value progression based on visit frequency
- Review seasonal variations in visit patterns

### 3. Competitive & Psychological Analysis
- Assess optimal reward thresholds that feel achievable yet meaningful
- Consider completion rates for different stamp card lengths (5, 7, 10 visits)
- Factor in customer psychology (endowed progress effect)
- Benchmark against successful loyalty programs in the market

## Deliverables Required

### Digital Stamp Card Program Design

**Program Structure:**
- Number of visits required to earn reward (based on data analysis)
- Timeframe for completion (30/45/60 days)
- Reward type and value (free item, discount, combo deal)
- Different tiers for different customer segments

**Segmented Stamp Card Options:**
- **New Customers**: [X visits in Y days = Z reward]
- **Regular Customers**: [X visits in Y days = Z reward]
- **High-Value Customers**: [X visits in Y days = Z reward]
- **Low-Frequency Targets**: [X visits in Y days = Z reward]

**Reward Optimization:**
- Specific reward offerings based on popular menu items
- Progressive rewards (bonus stamps for higher-value orders)
- Surprise elements (double stamp days, bonus rewards)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Digital tracking mechanism (app, SMS, phone number based)
- Progress visualization for customers
- Reminder/nudge strategy for incomplete cards
- Expiry and renewal policies

### Behavioral Triggers & Enhancements

**Acceleration Mechanics:**
- Double stamp opportunities (specific days/times/order values)
- Bonus stamps for referrals or social media engagement
- Seasonal multipliers during slow periods

**Retention Features:**
- Grace period for expired cards
- Rollover benefits for completed cards
- Exclusive member perks beyond stamp rewards

**Communication Strategy:**
- Progress updates and motivational messaging
- Urgency creation near expiry dates
- Celebration of milestones and completions

## Implementation Framework

### Testing & Optimization
- A/B testing different stamp requirements (5 vs 7 vs 10)
- Testing different timeframes and reward values
- Monitoring completion rates vs profitability impact

### Success Metrics
- Program enrollment rate
- Completion rate by segment
- Visit frequency increase per enrolled customer
- Revenue per customer improvement
- Program ROI and payback period

### Budget Planning
- Cost per reward distributed
- Operational costs (technology, communication)
- Expected revenue increase vs program costs
- Break-even analysis for different completion rates
